# == EDIT FROM HONDAGUYVTEC ==
This repository is a fork of the `Exempt_development_frontend` repository by `haseebah2003-blip`. I have merged my backend rule-checking logic with the frontend interface and can confirm that it is all working. I have also removed redundancies such as any server requests that were previously being made to an external backend rule checker algorithm, as this is no longer necessary.

To run this, simply clone this (forked) repository in VS Code by typing the command `git clone https://github.com/HondaGuyVTEC/Exempt_Development_Checker_Merged.git`, then type `npm run dev`.
